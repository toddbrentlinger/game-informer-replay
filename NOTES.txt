TODO: 
- Use hash map to get array of games played so do NOT have to check if every game is already in an array.

- Create base Episode class that contains static properties/methods and any instance properties/methods shared between Replay, SuperReplay, and eventually Test Chamber classes.

Third Season Episodes: 302-307
