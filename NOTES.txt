Game Informer Replay TODO:

- YouTube video player styling
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    height: calc((9 / 16) * 100vw);
    max-height: calc(100vh - 169px);
    min-height: 480px;
    background: #000;

7/23/21

- ISSUE: When displayed list changes, the previous image is displayed shortly until the right image loads in it's place.
SOLUTION: Somehow remove image before loading starts AND/OR use default loading image until new image finishes loading.

- If video player is currently playing AND the user scrolls down, the video player moves to a smaller window in the bottom corner. Reference YouTube.

7/9/21

X Add sliding animation from bottom of the screen to the scroll to top icon

7/7/21

- Add sliders in filter (Keep filter min/max values as static values in ReplayEpisode that are tracked when any new ReplayEpisode instance is added to the cache. Use these min/max values in the filter so no unnecessary values are included.):
	- liked ratio 
	- video length
	- airdate (include separte checkbox AND slider at the bottom)

- Filter Reference: NewEgg.com, SantaCruzNaturals.com, shopping stores sites, etc.

6/24/21

- Add full screen functionality like YouTube that has player take up full screen on top of document
and rest of the page can be scrolled down to interact.
	- Toggle full screen if click 'F' key
	- https://gomakethings.com/going-full-screen-with-vanilla-js/#:~:text=The%20Fullscreen%20API%20%23&text=requestFullscreen()%20method%20puts%20an,always%20called%20on%20the%20document%20)

6/21/21:

- Reference YouTube where video player is full width of the window. Should provide check or limit on player height NOT exceeding window height.

- Add Redux state logic. Mainly needed to track currently selected video. Maybe not needed.

Pre-6/21/21: 

- Fix image by setting ratio of black background that depends on thumbnail width or ratio.
Use trick by setting image container padding-top:XX% to certain percentage and positioning thumbnail
image to position:relative of container.

- Create base Episode class that contains static properties/methods and any instance properties/methods shared between Replay, SuperReplayEpisode, and eventually TestChamber classes.

- Since currPage and resultsPerPage do NOT change selectedEpisodes but filter/sort/search do, put them in separate components. Add DisplayedEpisodesList component with prop.selectedEpisodes and states currPage, resultsPerPage. ISSUE: clicking Reset List in parent should reset currPage state in child component.

- Add useEffect with dependency of selectedEpisodes that changes video player. Pass video player function as property to ReplayCollection component.

- Reference dropdown toggle used in GMM app to use on filter dropdown.

- ISSUE: Filter form AND search input does NOT reset checkboxes when 'Reset List' button is clicked.
SOLUTION: Send bool of isFilterEmpty() as prop to FilterSearch component? Or utilize useContext hook? OR send filterFormInit() function as prop that accepts parameter filterFormRef and assigns to ref in parent component that is run at first render only with useEffect.

X ISSUE: When reset filter form, clicking a checkbox that was previously checked does not filter episodes until unchecking and checking again.

- NOTE: Sort/Filter may NOT need to keep a state value. SelectedEpisodes is simply changed whenever sort/filter inputs are changed. However, sort needs to be referenced when filter changes. Could use a ref to read the value instead.

- Use hook useMemo for components that do NOT need to render every time parent re-renders. EX. FilterSearch only renders when state.filter is changed, PageNumbers only renders when states currPage, resultsPerPage, and state.selectedEpisodes is changed. Input elements in FilterSearch only re-render when isChecked has changed.

X Replace Play Video image overlay with FontAwesome Icon

X Combine 'search' and 'filter' cases in reducer by checking typeof action.value is either string or event.target

X Replace anchor link tags in thumbnails since they don't have src attributes which lowers Lighthouse score

X Use Set to get array of games played so do NOT have to check if every game is already in an array OR Map with title as key and count as property

X To find search terms, search for each property in ReplayEpisode instance. Need to check if property is string, array, or object. If string, return true if it contains search. If array, check each element. If object, check each property. Use recursive function.

X ISSUE: Filter and search should only show episodes that satisfy all choices instead of just one.
SOLUTION: If filter/search property has value AND episode does NOT contain value, return false. After each filter/search property is checked at end, return true.

X ISSUE: Filter/search should include episodes that include any selected crew and any selected segment instead of episodes that include all selected crew and segments.

X Use npm package react-player for YouTube video player

X ISSUE: If colorMode is 'dark', page is 'light' for split second before changing to 'dark'.
SOLUTION: Instead of useEffect, use useLayoutEffect
