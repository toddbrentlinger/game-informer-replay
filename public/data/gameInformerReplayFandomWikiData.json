But they weren't the only studio creating gorgeous yet grotesque sidescrolling spaces for players to delight in. Back in 2017, Tarsier Studios introduced players to the character Six and the world of Little Nightmares.", "The game follows our raincoat-clad heroine on a twisted tale through The Maw, a creepy underwater structure that houses only the most\u00a0ghoulish of creatures. Six is tiny compared to the rest of the inhabitants of The Maw and can't hang in a fight.\u00a0Thus our small protagonist must\u00a0sneak around and solve the many thrilling puzzles littered throughout the decrepit world. Its design lends itself nicely to\u00a0the category of little person, big world, so you know Jeff Cork is all in.", "Speaking of Jeff, join Andrew Reiner, Cork, Marcus Stewart, and me as we sneak through the harrowing hallways of Little Nightmares and try to make it through without dying (I have my doubts).", "We went live earlier, but you can catch the full archive of the stream above!\u00a0If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on\u00a0YouTube,\u00a0Twitch,\u00a0Twitter, and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0to get notified when we go live each week.\u00a0Thanks as always for watching and we hope you enjoy this week's show!", "Excited for Little Nightmares II? Be sure to check out our episode of New Gameplay Today where we show off Tarsier Studios' newest title and our impressions of our time with the game on a recent episode of\u00a0The GI Show. Fans of the series don't have long to wait, as Little Nightmares II drops on February 12 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and\u00a0PC." ]

The game focused on Gabriel Belmont and his buddy Patrick Stewert\u00a0Zobek as they try and save the world from the evil Lords of Shadow in the gameplay stylings of the early God of War games.", "Join Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, and me as we return to this Kojima Productions vision of the classic Castlevania franchise.", "We went live earlier, but you can catch the full archive of the stream above.\u00a0If you can't get enough of our live shows, remember to subscribe on YouTube, Twitch,\u00a0Mixer,\u00a0Twitter, and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0to get notified when we go live each week!" ]

An excerpt from my review: \"Remote charges allow you to sculpt explosions like an artist with an eye for urban landscaping. Singularity bombs and rockets create unpredictable (albeit awesome) messes. My favorite approach is to use a mech outfitted with jet boosters. Wildly flailing its arms through a building sends bodies and metal flying through the air. Landing the walker on a building is also quite amusing, as it often weighs more than the roofing, which results in the mech taking an express elevator to the lowest level.\"", "Enjoy the episode and we'll see you again in just seven days with another live episode." ]

It's bittersweet send off, but we couldn't be more excited for what comes next.", "This episode is much shorter than others, and we needed to cut it off to focus on what we're ushering in. If you are curious what that may be, watch the episode. We walk through our plans extensively, and also have a good discuss about Twisted Metal: Small Brawl in the process. Small Brawl released on November 26, 2001 for PlayStation and was developed by Incognito Entertainment. Kyle of course picks a van, but is is one series where he can be forgiven for doing that.", "Enjoy the episode, and we'll see you in seven days with Replay: Phase Two!" ]

All three of these games are developed by different teams and are interesting for a variety of reasons.", "This goes without saying, but we discuss all things Toy Story in this episode, and also speculate how Toy Story 4 will be.

We praised Heavy Iron Studios' work on the strange move set that SpongeBob uses to collect thousands of things, but grew bored of it quickly.", "Game Informer's Kyle Hilliard heard people loved this game, and wanted to see why. Will he agree with their assessment or ours? We come to somewhat of a conclusion after playing it for a good 30 minutes. Whether you like it or not, Battle for Bikini Bottom ends up being an interesting game to reflect on, as it identifies both the positives and negatives of licensed games.", "After looking at this game, we spend a little time with Alias, a game based on a television series that starred Jennifer Garner and was created by J. J. Abrams. The game didn't live up to the high standards of the show, but was ambitious in its missions and environment interaction.", "Thanks again for watching this silly little retrospective show. We'll be back again in seven days with another episode!" ]

Bionic Commando wasn't as iconic as those two juggernaut series, but that didn't stop Capcom from trying to thrust it into the limelight with a dark and gritty 2009 reboot.", "No longer was Bionic Commando a 2D sidescroller; now the game was a 3D action game with third-person shooting, a story full of wild twists, and the biggest departure from the original game: the ability to jump.

I'm an old-school skating fan, so I don't have much credibility in the sport now, but Leo Vader sure does. He hops into the hosting seat this week to show off Skate 3, a series that everyone wants back, but EA just doesn't want to make yet. In this lengthy look we dive into various aspects of the game, and even show off how it inspired Anthem. No, we're not joking. We found the inspiration point for Anthem. You'd think it would be something science-fiction based, but nope, it was Skate 3.", "In our second segment, we dedicate roughly 15 minutes to Monster House, a game based on the theatrical release that starts slow, but ends up impressing us in the end. Enjoy the episode, which I think has the best camera work and editing in Replay history." ]

United Front laid off 120 employees and appeared to be heading toward closure. At this point, most games and studios don't get a second chance at life, but for whatever reason, Activision decided to release the publishing rights of True Crime: Hong Kong, and Square Enix swooped in to save the project. The game was renamed Sleeping Dogs and development continued with another 60-plus employees being added to the team.", "In this episode of Replay, we show off the opening moments of play in Sleeping Dogs' Definitive Edition for PlayStation 4. This brief look gives a good snapshot of why this game is special and why you should play it if you haven't already. We dedicate the entire episode to this one game, and are joined by two guests that fit the theme perfectly." ]

Black Monday's director,\u00a0Naresh Hirani, was a producer on L.A. Noire. So, just keep that in mind while Reiner, Reeves, and Hanson all make fun of me." ]

We took a look at the console version, and Ben Reeves did his best to make progress within it. Former Game Informer editor Bryan Vore gave the 3DS version an 8.25 out of 10 review score, and had this to say about it:", "\"While some players won\u2019t tune into the Kingdom Hearts series again until the title includes a \u201cIII,\u201d others keep up with the new installments no matter what. Dream Drop Distance is one of those titles that reaffirms your faith in Kingdom Hearts (like Birth by Sleep) rather feeling like an obligation (like Re:coded). If you\u2019ve passed up other non-numbered entries, this game provides an extensive journal brimming with plot summaries and character info. It\u2019s not easy to boil-down a 10-year-old series as convoluted as Kingdom Hearts can sometimes be, but Dream Drop Distance does a great job.\"", "Whether you have played every Kingdom Hearts title or not, we urge you to hear the wisdom Kim delivers. It's fascinating to hear her talk about one of her favorite gaming series. Enjoy the episode, folks, and we'll be back with yet another episode in just seven short days.\u00a0" ]

Best described as \"kind of like Q*bert\" and \"flat-out weird,\" Catherine is a hard game to describe, but is damn fun, and worth a look for everyone who is looking for something new to play. ", "If you like what you see, and want to give the game a whirl yourself, it just released on Steam eight days ago, and is heading to PlayStation 4 and Vita soon as a \"Full Body\" enhanced edition with more content, including a third love interest." ]

Case in point: 2005's Project Snowblind, a game many people remember for having existed. It released in what now seems like a strange era for shooters; far removed from the more high-octane romps of the 90s, but not quite in time to be part of the ADS trend that took the genre by storm a few years after. Anyway, Reiner, Leo, and I run this shooter through its cyber paces, and tackle a more classic game right after." ]

The Fatal Frame series, which is known as Project Zero in Japan, delivers a unique survival horror experience that pushes the player to use a camera to vanquish ghosts. As goofy as this may sound, the developers at Tecmo Koei make most ghost encounters frightful. They often appear when you least expect them to, and often blend in with the environment to the degree that you can't really trust what you are seeing.", "Crimson Butterfly delivers chilling visuals at a feverish pace. Game Informer loved it back in 2003, giving the game a score of 9.25 out of 10. Since this is Replay, we do our best to not focus on the game and have the most random of conversations and the worst of times. We hope you enjoy the episode, and have a great (and safe) Halloween!" ]

As we marvel at this important title, we discuss the series as a whole, and ask the important question: Is Dead Space 3 a good game? The jury is divided on that one, but there's a clear correct answer to it (mine).", "If are here wondering where our final look at Commodore 64 is, you'll find that roughly 45 minutes into the episode after our look at Dead Space concludes.

Well, as beautifully as a game about thwacking zombies apart with chainsaws and sledgehammers can get.\u00a0", "Studio closures aren't ever a reason to celebrate, but these two hit us particularly hard.

We figure this clunky console port is the best way for people to see just how old the Diablo series is. You'll quickly learn that it's super old. Like \"are we looking at a wall or door?\" kind of old.", "Diablo originally released on PC on December 31, 1996, and many of the hallmark features we turn to this series for today were in that original version. Jeff Cork joins me for a co-op session, and we make a decent amount of progress before disaster sinks in. Turns out, Cork should not be trusted with a bow and arrow.", "We also dive into a number of NES games for a variety of quick looks. Enjoy the episode, and come back for a new one in seven days!" ]

This game holds up surprisingly well, and currently sits near the top of our list as a game we wouldn't mind Super Replaying in the future. If you second this motion, let us know in the comments section below.", "Also, this is the final episode of Replay: Season 4! You are probably confused why we create seasons, and may think we're just making things up as we go. We use seasons as a way to review our work and determine where the show should go next. At the end of Season 3, we took a month-long break to create a new direction for the show. We won't be taking a break leading into Replay: Season 5. We'll be back next week with a slightly different look back at the games of yesteryear. And for those asking, the God Hand Super Replay is right around the corner. Buckle up. It's going to be a wild one." ]

This post-apocalyptic shooter wasn't as well received as the aforementioned series, but still had a loyal following of fans. Me included. I gave the game review rating of 9 out of 10, and praised its fluid controls, vibe, and combat encounters. \"Rage\u2019s story and overworld design feel dated, but its heart-pounding gunplay is a nice change of pace in a market filled with \u201cfollow me\u201d and pop-and-fire shooters,\" I said in that review. \"While light RPG elements are present, this is mainly a game for players who love challenging combat experiences.\"", "How well did this ambitious shooter hold up? Better than you would think. Jeff Cork, Leo Vader, and Kyle Hilliard joined me for a look at Rage's introductory moments, and both declared it to be the best shooter they've ever seen. I was shocked by their praise, but rolled with it, and we ended up having an amazing time. Watch the video for yourself, and I'm guessing you'll be counting down the days until Rage 2 releases in 2019.", "Our second game is even better, a true showpiece of technology. We hope you enjoy the episode, and check back in seven days for another look back at the games of yesteryear." ]

Brotherhood scored a 9.25 out of 10 from Game Informer critic Matt Miller and is widely considered the most accomplished Assassin's Creed game to date, but maybe not the most important. It sits at number 75 on Game Informer's Top 300 Games of All Time list, not far behind Assassin's Creed II, which is locked in at number 29, and was the game that built the foundation for Brotherhood. These games are held in high accord for numerous reasons, but the biggest one, which unifies the entire trilogy, is just how likeable Ezio is. He was complex, charismatic, conflicted, and we watched him transform into a more responsible person as he aged. It was a fully established character arc that sadly hasn't been repeated by any Assassin's Creed game that followed.", "We take a look at the opening hour of the game. Apologies for the lack of Replay Roulette these last two weeks, but we felt these juggernaut releases deserved more time. Replay returns to its normal (and likely terrible) programming next week. See you again in seven days. Enjoy the episode!" ]

For the sake of 300, we had no qualms in revisiting this game for a more focused conversation about this important (and awesome) game.

Enjoy the show. Enjoy the 300th issue. We'll be back in seven days with another 300 themed episode, this time with a pick from yours truly." ]

The main character is an embarrassment to gaming, and isn\u2019t even believable enough to be considered for a Renaissance fair\u2019s cast. As much as I enjoyed seeing him take a sword to the face, most enemies would appear to have extreme cases of glaucoma, as they swing and miss most of the time, and have a difficult time navigating around walls. Sadly, even with an impressive stock of weapons at your disposal, your combat prowess isn\u2019t much better. The choppy animations, inconsistent framerate, and inopportune loads make it nearly impossible to navigate the battlefield with effective grace. The game\u2019s only redeeming qualities \u2013 deep spell and weapon systems \u2013 just go to waste in this abysmal quest. If you\u2019ve spent a lifetime sinning, by all means, trek into this world to get a taste of what awaits you in Hell. 2 out of 10.\"", "Yes, I ended up giving Two Worlds a point for each world, and you'll soon see just how broken this game was. It was also ambitious, as was developer Reality Pump, which used this foundation to build a much better adventure in Two Worlds II. Unintentional hilarity ensues in this episode of Replay. Some of it comes at the expense of poor horses toward the end of the episode. Make sure you stick around for a look back at another \"classic\" game. And check back Sunday at 12:01 a.m. CT for the first episode of our Killer 7 Super Replay." ]

On this episode of Replay, we dive into Silent Hill 4: The Room's opening moments, and show off just how dangerous diseased dogs can be. We don't make much progress, but we do get far enough to show off how combat and exploration work. We're also really good at counting, as you'll soon see. The Room released for Xbox and PlayStation 2 on September 7, 2004. A PC version was released at a later date.", "Our second segment takes a look at a weird cooperative game on Super Nintendo. Just figuring out how to play cooperatively requires a manual. If this discovery isn't reason alone to watch, I don't know what is. Enjoy the episode, folks!" ]

As the experiments and theories began to take shape, science defeated common sense, and something went wrong. Something went terribly wrong. As your bathysphere descends toward this revered paradise, you are hit with the sinking fear that mankind may have gone too far. It\u2019s not until you step foot in the ruins of this city that you realize just how real this fear is.", "This is the intro paragraph to my BioShock review. I was blown away by this game, giving it a rating of 10 out of 10, and showering it with hyperbole along the lines of calling it \"ingenious, enthralling, and a masterpiece of the most epic proportions.\" BioShock originally released on August 21, 2007, and has recently come back for its 10th anniversary on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Would you kindly click the play button below to see why I call it one of video games' most important titles? Seriously, click the damn button." ]

No, these aren't old games that fit Replay's criteria, but we also don't care that much about said criteria. This show has been running for like eight years or something, so cut us some slack. We just want to have fun playing games that have Santa in them. Do you really have a problem with that? ", "If you do have a problem with it, please leave your complaints in the comments section below. We'll get them to the right people.

      "content": [ "Capcom's storied history of survival-horror games extends far beyond Resident Evil. In 2005, Capcom released a game called Haunting Ground on PlayStation 2, which begins with the controversial scenario of waking up in an unknown place, imprisoned, and without clothes. The uncomfortable intro gives way to gameplay survival-horror fans know oh so well, fleeing for your life, and solving puzzles to open doors and reveal useful items. In this episode of Replay we check out this little-known Capcom title, which was slammed by Game Informer back in the day, scoring a 4.75 out of 10.", "In our 40 minutes with the game, we may like it more now than our critics did. Of course, we are only scratching the surface of what this game offers. We didn't get to see how the dog is integrated into the gameplay design. ", "This episode's second segment is older and far more shocking. Thanks again for watching and all of the support for seven-plus years. We'll see you in seven days!" ]

In 2008, however, developer Propaganda Games and publisher Touchstone Games (which is affiliated with Disney Interactive Studios, strangely) tried to reboot the series with a game clearly inspired Aliens that throws in some dinosaurs and recognizable voice actors for good measure.", "Andrew Reiner, the voice of Leo Vader, and I are joined this week by someone you don't hear too often. Creative director Jeff Akervik (last seen/heard here) joins us for a look at, hopefully, not the last time a developer tries to make a Turok game. For part two, we do one of my favorite things, which is to go in with zero expectations and discover a bizarre gem.", "It's worth noting that there were some gameplay audio recording issues with these games, so if you're not hearing all the sound effects, that's why. Apologies!" ]

Dan Tack, previously stuck in Stuart Little, has become a profanity laced character within the game. After begging for help and shilling his Twitch channel he is thrown into prison.

Along with Capcom's stunning remake of Resident Evil, Konami brought the original Metal Gear Solid back in a big way with the help of developer Silicon Knights. Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes brings back the critically acclaimed stealth/espionage action from Hideo Kojima's 1998 PlayStation game with improved graphics, new story sequences, and the ability to shoot from a first-person view.", "Our stealth skills are a little rusty, but we make good headway in this amazing restored game, and even take a second to rattle off the order of our favorite Metal Gear games. Feel free to jot yours down in the comments section below as we play through the beginning of Twin Snakes. Also stick around for an odd second segment, which is more so a plea I make for a new PlayStation 4 game to be localized here in the States. Our final segment of this episode may not be safe for work, so put a blanket over your computer or TV as you watch it, okay?", "Thanks again for all of the support throughout the years.

Although it drew critical acclaim, Ninja Theory's recent reboot still hasn't garnered a sequel, and Capcom hasn't hinted at any kind of return. With the fate of the series hanging in the air, fans have debated whether Capcom should go back to the original series and release Devil May Cry 5, or let Ninja Theory get a second shot with a new Devil May Cry 2. We discuss this topic and explore the series as a whole in our brief look at the opening moments of Devil May Cry 3. ", "Where does this entry rank among the best stylish action games? Is this the best Devil May Cry? You'll find out our take in this episode. We also discover the greatest sports game ever made, and go well out of our way to show you everything it has to offer.", "As always, enjoy the episode. We can't thank you enough for your support through the years. The Replay Machine would also like to thank you, and intently urges you to sit as close to the screen as possible while watching. See you in seven days!" ]

By no means is it a great game, but when you have a group of friends over, it can be a great experience.", "We give you a nice taste of what to expect from this title, and our second segment dives into another long-forgotten Kinect series that brings out the true talents of Game Informer's Kyle Hilliard. Enjoy the episode, everyone, and thanks again for all of the support throughout the years." ]

It's a game people will still be talking about five years from now. Come to think of it, they may have a lot more to talk about by then.\"", "As we talk about what makes this series tick, we also show off a minute of footage from Prince of Persia: Assassins, a canceled game that gave way to the Assassin's Creed we know and love.", "After a strange break, we return for a look at a second game in another Roulette segment. We hope you enjoy the new season, and let us know what games you would like to see on future episodes. We have a busy Replay and Super Replay schedule planned, but we're always looking for suggestions. Thanks for all of the support over the first three seasons. It means more than you'll ever know." ]

And, as we soon learned, piles and piles of caterpillars also made the transition. Join Andrew Reiner, Kyle Hilliard, and me as we swing our brains out in a search for the elusive 5 hit combo.", "Its visual presentation may be predictably stale, but Kyle was won over by Rygar: The Legendary Adventure's Diskarmor action. It's a good thing, because he ended up having to play through a significant amount of the game twice. ProTip: Save your games. Don't worry, we were completely supportive of Kyle's failings.", "After that, we take a look at another old game and get completely lost. Thanks, Kyle!" ]

That off-the-wall pick for Replay was received well, so I figured we would dive into the RPG well again with another Reiner-certified pick. Tales of Vesperia is an Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 JRPG that puts its character ensemble front and center. The beginning is slow (something I feared for an episode of Replay), but it does a nice job of setting the game's tone and establishing Yuri as the lead protagonist. You can read Matt Miller's review of the game here.", "We shy away from RPGs on this show given just how difficult they can be to demo, so please let us know if you like (or hate) seeing games like these on the show. There's a mountain of games just like it that we would love to introduce to you, but, well, maybe that isn't what Replay is for. Your feedback will help determine what we do next. It always does.", "In our second segment, we stick to our guns with another RPG that is cited as the PlayStation's first. It's an odd title that ended up impressing our crew with its stylish battle system.", "I hope you enjoy the episode and come back again in seven days for another look at the game's of yesteryear. Replay: Season 4 is right around the corner, so expect plenty of experimenting in the week's to come. Have a great weekend, everyone!" ]

It never had the opportunity to broadened its universe with a sequel, but it has a following of devoted fans. I've heard it be called a favorite game of all time on more than one occasion.", "Today Andrew Reiner and Brian Shea try to convince a very, very skeptical Kyle Hilliard that he should really gave this game a shot." ]

Confusing naming conventions aside, this is one of the best role-playing games ever made, and is often cited as one of top Super Nintendo releases. ", "In this week's Replay, we take a lengthy look at the game's action-packed intro, show off the memorable opera scene, and give you a small taste of open-world exploration. We also dive into another lesser-known Super Nintendo RPG, and discuss other titles that released around the same time. It was a great era for gaming, and you'll soon see that Final Fantasy III hasn't lost much of its charm in the decades that followed.", "Thanks again for watching our silly little show. We'll see you again in seven days." ]

When a zone was freed, the color came back to it and the people too to the streets again. We explore the opening moments of this unique open-world game, and find ourselves amazed by the small touches; mostly those dealing with cows.", "Our second segment takes a look back at one of the earliest western games, something we thought was appropriate with Red Dead Redemption 2 being revealed earlier this week." ]

It's a vehicle combat game comparable to Twisted Metal (or perhaps more appropriately, Vigilante 8) where players battle it out for Jabba The Hutt's entertainment. In the Star Wars storyline, it takes place right before Return of the Jedi, but does feature some Phantom Menace vehicles and robots. When Disney announced it would be getting rid of all the expanded universe Star Wars fiction ahead of the release of The Force Awakens, we mentioned Demolition as a game we did not mind being forgotten, and this episode of Replay does a good job explaining why.", "For the second part of Replay, we take a look at a PlayStation 2 game that time has been much kinder to." ]

Its marketing pointed to a September 1995 release, but during E3 of that year Sega announced the console was available immediately, effectively cutting the prep-time of Sega's assorted retail partners by four months. It was a move that ultimately doomed it.", "The system is considered a commercial failure by most standards, but it is home to a few enduring classics like the Panzer Dragoon series and Nights. Unfortunately, we don't look at either of those games, and instead grab a bunch of random games that look promising. We start with Enemy Zero (which has a surprising connection to our current Super Replay) before moving on to lesser known Saturn games like Three Dirty Dwarves. Enjoy!" ]

This time, however, Sonic turns into a werehog at night, stripping him of most of his speed and giving him abilities like super strength and stretchy arms. Join Jeff Cork, Kyle Hilliard, Andrew Reiner, and me as we dive into this game and see if it's as bad as so many people have painted it over the years.

It also considered a failure.", "This week on Replay, Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, Javy Gwaltney, and me take a look back at the bizarre system, running through a handful of games that include guest stars like Hulk Hogan, a post-apocalyptic human versus anthropomorphic mutant animal beat 'em up, a Rear Window simulator, and more than one abstract science-fiction adventure. It's a strange trip down a rabbit hole of a console that few have memories for and there are some gems, to be sure.", "Arguably the Philips CD-i's biggest claim to fame, is that it hosted four games with Nintendo's characters thanks to loopholes present in the relationship mentioned above. We don't play those games in this episode, but we did a previous episode. For our Replay of Hotel Mario and two of the Zelda games that released on Philips CD-i, head here. For a similar round-up of games from another forgotten console, head here for our Replay covering the TurboGrafx-16." ]

We featured it on our May 2006 cover in tandem with a large feature detailing Nintendo's new console. It was the mature, third-party answer to Wii Sports, but it only took a few minutes of play to begin to question just how capable the Wii Remote was going to be at delivering the new experiences the console was promising.", "Join myself, Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, and Ben Reeves as we look back at the game and have varying degrees of luck with its motion controls.

We bounce around levels within the campaign to show off some of its crazier developments, and then sink a considerable amount of time into the multiplayer, which most Game Informer staffers agree is better than GoldenEye's.", "And after Perfect Dark we take a look at not one, but two additional games, both bringing a level of sucktitude we didn't expect. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the episode, folks. We'll see you again shortly in Replay and the next Super Replay." ]

The game serves as somewhat of a prequel to the film, showing us what happened three months prior to The Warriors gang being framed for murder. The story periodically parallels the motion picture's, with additional action sequences and plot giving us a fuller picture. Many of the film's actors reprise their roles in game as voice actors.", "In this episode of Replay we check out the opening moments of The Warriors, which are chock full of violence, controversy, and plenty of stupid jokes from the Replay crew. This look shows off most of the fighting mechanics and just how ridiculous the looting can be. We make great progress in the game before switching gears to the final round of this year's Super Replay Showdown, which pits the overly tall Javy Gwaltney against me. Will this be a fair competition that truly shows us who the best gamer in the office is? You'll have to tune in to the battle to find out!", "\u00a0" ]

With five years behind eyes, and a different crew to take a \"first look\" at the game, I figured we'd give Curse another look. It always hit me as a survival horror game that had a different vibe. The haunted museum angle also seemed cool. It turns out I wasn't wrong. You'll have to let us know what you think of the game after this viewing. The Replay crew wants to see more from it.

It is the closest the series has gotten to a traditional Pok\u00e9mon RPG on consoles, but it's missing too many key components of what makes the handheld games so great to have a real lasting legacy. The game was published by The Pok\u00e9mon Company, but developed by a studio called Genius Sonority, which is mostly known for creating Pok\u00e9mon spin-offs. We gave the game a poor review upon release (which you will hear us talk about in the episode) and other outlets were not much kinder.", "Join myself, Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, and the office's biggest Pok\u00e9mon fan, Ben Hanson, as we play through the game's opening and try to figure out why this game wasn't able to be the console Pok\u00e9mon RPG everyone wanted it to be." ]

", "In hindsight, for this week's Replay, we should have let Tim pick his own game \u2013 a title he loves like Sonic the Hedgehog 3 or that Dead Space 3 garbage, but we instead choose another horrible survival horror game. Welcome to The Ring: Terror's Realm, a video game take on the popular series of Japanese novels and films. Released exclusively on Dreamcast in 2000, The Ring kicks off with an unexplainable death that may be linked to a computer program. Jeff Cork, Kyle Hilliard, and I join Tim for the opening moments of this game, which starts off with a bang.", "Our second segment involves a camera and acting from all four us. What we get into is laborious and lengthy, but there's a great pay off to it. Thanks again for watching, and we'll see you again in seven days for another episode! Special thanks go out to Chase and his father for recommending The Ring to us! You guys are the best!" ]

Kim Wallace, Game Informer's JRPG expert, is on hand to insight and criticize Turi's should he do something wrong.

Using a technology called \"Geometry Modifiction\" or \"Geo-Mod,\" the player can use explosives to destroy and tunnel through the terrain. If a door won't open, simply blow out the wall next to it. Game Informer's Tim Turi expertly shows off this powerful technology in this week's episode. He's joined by Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, and Ben Hanson. We also veer off of the single-player campaign to check out Red Faction's two-player multiplayer, which is still surprisingly great.", "Our second segment takes us to Japan for a look at a peculiar mash-up of worlds.

The game didn't live up to the hype established by famed creator John Romero. To this day, Daikatana is considered one of the biggest flops in gaming.", "We have a special gift for tracking down games that permeate a certain stench, and decided to give Daikatana a spin. We check out the game's opening moments, and also bounce around to different levels to see just how crazy this adventure gets.", "The show's second segment takes a look back at this year's Extra Life marathon (which raised over $38,000 for Gillette Children\u2019s Specialty Healthcare). The show's final segment is another bloody Versus battle. Four editors enter. One dies. Those are the rules.", "We hope you enjoy the FPS carnage in this week's episode.

After crafting the first Star Wars Battlefront title, which finally brought Star Wars gamers the full-scale battles they saw on the silver screen, Pandemic released another enormously successful title called Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. This open-world game places the player in North Korea in 2007, with the specific goal of preventing nuclear war.", "This feat requires the player to pick off the key military leaders featured in a deck of 52 cards. Much like Avalanche Studios' current hit series, Just Cause, Mercenaries pushed the player to accomplish this goal with mass amounts of destruction. Mercenaries was one of the first titles that truly captured the \"sandbox\" experience that embraced creative choice in how missions were tackled. In 2005, Pandemic was one of the top developers in the industry, releasing Mercenaries, Star Wars Battlefront II, and a fun little game called Destroy All Humans.", "After a lengthy look at Mercenaries, we foolishly dive headfirst into one of the worst fighting games of yesteryear, yet find ourselves moderately charmed by its hideous character designs.

Scratch that \u2013 it's actually more like a loser-dies-horribly Fusion Frenzy tournament. Who end up on the bottom of the dog pile? Watch the video to find out." ]

Some third-party publishers launched interesting new IPs on the console as well, and if you ever made it all the way to the \"z\" section of your local retailer you might have spotted the adorable characters on the Zack & Wiki box. For this week's Replay, we return to Capcom's little hidden treasure on the Wii.", "This 2007 title stars a little mute pirate named Zack and his cuddly monkey pal, Wiki (who looks suspiciously like Data from Capcom's Mega Man Legends). Take a glance at Zack & Wiki and you might expect something like a traditional platformer, but it's actually a colorful adventure game with more in common with LucasArts' classic point-and-clicks. Stay tuned for the second segment where we hatch open another forgotten third-party title from a Nintendo console. This week it's Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, and me. We're also happy to be joined by longtime Replay fan Nick Ransbottom, who members of our Facebook group I Watched the Entire Overblood Super Replay may recognize.\u00a0" ]

Some acts of god can't be avoided, however. Such is the case when former Game Informer editor and current Giant Bomb chucklehead Dan Ryckert invades the most recent episode of Replay. I wish I could say this upsetting twist of fate was offset by a high-quality game, but sadly this week's Replay features something nearly as unsavory as Mr. Ryckert: Sonic the Hedgehog 2006.", "Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 is considered by many to be the absolute low point of the Sega mascot's career. Erratic, touchy controls collide with an unpredictable camera, resulting in chaotic combat and platforming. The story is also an oddity, featuring unlikable characters like Silver and Shadow. Sonic also seduces a young girl. Stay tuned after the Sonic '06 nonsense as all four of us pick up the controller for a comparably queasy Sonic game from the Dreamcast era. So please join Andrew Reiner, Ben Hanson, me, and an especially raunchy Dan Ryckert as we reunite the old-school Replay crew for this special episode." ]

All of the film footage featured in the game is of airplanes flying around shooting alien ships. The game follows this blueprint and ends up being one of the most poorly constructed aerial-combat games of its day.", "Independence Day is developed by Radical Entertainment and published by the now-defunct Fox Interactive. Tim Turi does his best to fly planes and shoot space nipples, but the gameplay he tries to wrangle may even be worse than Cyberia's. Rather than going outside, grilling food, and drinking in the sun, join us for 40 minutes of bad gaming. That's the best way to enjoy this holiday!" ]

What they don't know is Largo is resourceful and willing to go to any length to protect his empire.", "In the years following the launch of the comic book, Largo Winch has been adopted into a movie, television series, and a handful of games \u2013 most of which never made their way stateside. In this week's Replay episode, we take a look at one game that did come to our shores: Largo Winch: Commando SAR for PlayStation. Developed by Rebellion Games and published by Ubisoft, this 2001 gem handles stealth gameplay a little differently than you've likely seen before. Bad game player, Tim Turi, does his best to make Largo look like the \"jet-set super hero\" that the game's box says he is. As if I need to say it, this is a rough ride, folks.", "In our second segment, Jeff Marchiafava shares thoughts on another game no one has ever heard of. Our final segment today is the first round of the Super Replay Showdown! Ben Hanson has put together an interesting selection of games for the tournament this year. Thanks again for watching our silly little show, and come back next week for another episode!" ]

      "content": [ "In the second episode of Replay's third season, Tim Turi meets Vito Corleone for the first time. That's right. He's never seen The Godfather films or read the books. We figure his best introduction to this beloved crime story is through the video game adaptations by Electronic Arts. He gets to experience the violence firsthand. Tim slides into character within seconds, doing all the things you see in the films, like starting himself on fire, threatening ham (yes, you read that correctly), and driving cars on sidewalks to apparently shake people down.", "This episode also introduces two new segments to the Replay show, one that dives deep into a developer's past, and another that shows off the secrets hidden in games. We hope you enjoy the show. Let us know what you think of the episode, The Godfather, and Tim's performance in the comments section below." ]

Ideas like \"Wouldn't it be cool if we had cameras in the studio?\" and \"We should create a competitive league that culminates in a tournament,\" were tossed around, but were never acted on, because truthfully, we didn't have the means to pull them off the way we wanted to. That changes today. Welcome to Replay: Season 3!", "The heart and soul of Replay are not changing, and never will, but we felt it was time to shake up the show and give it a slightly different identity \u2013 starting with cameras in the studio. Although the cameras are rolling for the recording of an entire episode, you won't see us on-screen at all times. We are using them sparingly, and mostly to show off peripherals we are using, and to capture the emotional outbursts of our crew.", "We've also dreamed up a host of new ideas for our second segments, but we don't want to ruin the surprises we have lined up for the weeks and months ahead. One of the hopes, which I think you'll see in this episode, is to find different ways to get the Game Informer staff involved in Replay, even if it is for a few minutes. We play games daily here, and have countless stories to share with you. We think we've found a way to do that.", "For the first episode of Season 3, Tim Turi, Kyle Hilliard, Jeff Cork, and I looked for a game that stood out from the crowd, and settled on Team Ico's remarkable PlayStation 2 experience, Shadow of the Colossus. We discuss the impact this 2005 release had on video games, talk about the development studio behind it, and share our thoughts on its successor, The Last Guardian.", "After watching us play Shadow, stick around for a new take on one of our favorite second segments. We didn't expect it to be this intense.", "As always, we welcome your feedback on the show in the comments section below, on YouTube, and over at the I Watched the Entire Overblood Super Replay group on Facebook. We hope you enjoy the show, and thanks for sticking with us for over five years. We couldn't keep going without your support!" ]

The Mega Man X games are among my favorites and I have lost count of the number of times I've played through the first two in the series. The speed of platforming coupled with the ability to dash and climb on walls makes even simple movements quick and fun. Couple that with fun shooting an attractive art style and an interesting near post-apocolyptic story that follows up the original Mega Man's escapades in a cool way (trust me, it's there if you look for it), I am confident the Mega Man X games will always be fun.", "You'll definitely want to stick around for our second segment, as well, where we look at a pair of quirky Genesis games." ]

Having looked at Banjo-Kazooie two years ago, we figured it was time to see how its sprawling sequel holds up. I was fortunate enough to review the game back in the day, giving it a 9 out of 10 and saying, \"The sequel is still a 3D platformer at heart, but the boundaries have been removed, which makes it more like Zelda than anything else. The new worlds are gigantic, spanning as far as the eye can see. While there are noticeable separations between zones, Rare tried to deliver the impression that everything is connected, like pieces in a puzzle. If you enjoyed Banjo-Kazooie, there's a good chance you won't like this sequel. You'll oftentimes find yourself stuck with no idea what to do next, and exploration highlight outweighs the action.\" But once I found my way in this world, it delivered plenty of great content, including the ability to transform into a wide variety of things, including appliances.", "Kim Wallace, Tim Turi, Ben Reeves, and I discuss this strange facet of the game in this week's episode, and experience firsthand just how confusing the overworld can be. Platforming maestro Tim does his best to see as much of this sequel as possible, but all of our focus is jarred by a story point involving Bottles. We hope you enjoy this episode, and make sure you stick around for the second segment, which shows off another great duo." ]

In order to celebrate, we thought we'd kick things off with a special edition of Replay, in which we take a look at all three titles in Factor 5's Rogue Squadron series.", "Andrew Reiner, Tim Turi, Ben Reeves, Wade Wojcik, and I start our journey with the first few levels of the original Rogue Squadron on N64, as Tim shoots down probe droids and TIE Bombers on Tatooine, and tries his best not to blow a dreaded escort mission on Barkesh. Things get more interesting (and pretty) in Rogue Leader, which starts(!) with the Death Star trench run and has us questioning the Empire's design decisions. Also during the second segment, Reiner discusses a canceled fourth Rogue Squadron game, with some juicy details from a former developer. Finally, we take a look at the troubled third installment, Rebel Strike. Sure, the flying segments were still great, but the new on-foot levels \u2013 including our dubious rescue of Princess Leia \u2013 brought the fun to a crashing (if unintentionally hilarious) hault. See it all by clicking the video below." ]

Cyborg werewolves with sunglasses, tiny friendly robots, and the dramatic destruction of an entire city await.", "Join Kyle Hilliard, Andrew Reiner, Tim Turi, and Wade Wojcik as they dive into the insanity of Hard Corps, complete with flying robot torsos and a hitched ride aboard a speeding plane. Also, stay tuned for the return of one of Replay's goofier second segments coupled with a beloved Nintendo platformer." ]

We discuss the importance of this series, the history it had before this entry, and go well out of our way to make fun of Ben Hanson. We also try to get Jeff Marchiafava to speak Japanese.

She brought us The Sniper 2, a little known title that never made its way stateside, and only released in Europe and Japan. Created by Midas Interactive Entertainment and D3 Publishing, The Sniper 2 is a truly awful exercise in precision shooting. It may even be worse at communicating a story.

Clock Tower\u00a0introduced us to Scissorman and swapped between three different character scenarios. The story kept you wondering who would be attacked next and exactly who was behind the man who took such delight in cutting apart people's insides.\u00a0", "In this episode of Replay, join Andrew Reiner, Tim Turi, Jeff Marchiafava, and Kim Wallace as they look at how this classic holds up, find out just what it takes to get away from Scissorman, and attempt to predict the culprit. More importantly, will they survive the old-school mechanics? \u00a0\u00a0" ]

      "content": [ "In the video game world, the name \"James Bond\" usually leads to a discussion about GoldenEye. People rarely talk about Electronic Arts' time with Ian Fleming's famed secret agent, which is surprising since that's where most of his video game history lies.", "Under Electronic Arts' watch, Bond starred in Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, Everything or Nothing, GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, and From Russia With Love. Electronic Arts announced a game based on the film Casino Royale, but development delays pushed it outside of the movie's release window, and it was canceled shortly thereafter. The Bond rights were then snatched up by Activision.", "Having already recorded a Replay episode for GoldenEye, we decided to dive into an Electronic Arts title next. What better place to start than with the game starring the best Bond of all: Sean Connery. We play through the opening of From Russia With Love, and geek out over Bond's time on the silver screen in the process. We also do our best to convince grumpy Jeff Cork to watch these films. ", "Our brief look shows off most of what the game has to offer: Bond being Bond, Bond shooting bad buys, Bond using a jet pack, Bond recklessly driving a car, Bond picking up a girl, Bond talking to Q, and Bond getting lost in a hedge maze. That last one may not scream Bond, but you'll see it happen in this episode.", "And after that first segment, stick around for a look at a second game that ties in with 007." ]

Super Replay fans, take note: This game is set on Christmas Eve, which gives it extra points as far as being considered for our next Big Show.

The idea of being an adult that gets paid to play, write about, and talk about video games on a daily basis sounded unbelievably awesome, and I wanted every major decision in my life to point towards that defined end goal. Between then and 2009, I got a job at Funcoland the day I was eligible at age 16, shot a commercial for the company, bought a shark suit and ran around the Game Informer offices at 18, wrote over 600 video game reviews in college, and paid my way out to E3 every year to check out new games and bug Andy McNamara about hiring me. That path paid off, and he hired me in August of 2009. Five years later, it\u2019s time to say goodbye.", "These five years have been unbelievable, and I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work on so many rewarding projects. First and foremost has been my involvement in our Replay show from day one. I'm thrilled with the current state of the industry and look forward to new experiences just as much as anyone, but I've always found it important to keep the past fresh in my mind. Being able to sit down and play old games for hundreds of Replay episodes has been a blast, largely thanks to the conversations with Tim Turi, Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, Jeff Marchiafava, Ben Reeves, Ben Hanson, Bryan Vore, Matt Helgeson, Phil Kollar, and others that aren't named Joe Juba. Interacting with the Replay community has always been fantastic, whether it was on Facebook fan groups, during lunches at PAX East, personal visits to the office, or even random encounters at Minneapolis bars.", "There are a ton of other fun, dumb things I've done over the years, and I'll put a big-ass list of them here since modesty is one of my many desirable qualities:", "Bringing my dad to the office to make him play games (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014)", "Reviewing fart apps with Peter Molyneux", "Bringing GWAR to the office to play Dance Central", "Setting a Guinness World Record with Tim, Cork, and Reeves", "Crashing the Skyrim launch in a Professor Genki suit", "Writing an actual smart guy journalism-y thing about mobile development", "Telling you all that Noobz sucks, followed by the director throwing a tantrum on Twitter and calling me a \"failed musician\"", "Trying to remind everyone that games are a lot of fun", "Getting put into L.A.

I'm going to be moving out west for my new gig, but I'm happy to say that I'll be staying in the industry I love. I plan on returning to Minnesota on occasion to visit my friends and the office, and I'll make it a priority to show up on Replay if they'll have me. If you want to keep up with my weird life and can deal with a bunch of wrestling crap, you can follow me on Twitter. If you're a fan of watching my dumb ass on videos, I assure you that there will be a damn near intolerable amount of that happening in the near future.\u00a0", "I could ramble more about how awesome my time here has been, but you get the point.

Today, we're hoping to destroy another one of Tim's memories with a deep dive into Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, another game that he played the hell out of in his prepubescent years. ", "Released exclusively for Nintendo 64 on November 30, 1999, Legacy of Darkness takes place eight years before the events in Castlevania 64, and is seen through the eyes of a peculiar lead: a werewolf named Cornell. His adventure gets off to a hell of a start. We work our way through a village engulfed in flames and overrun with dreaded rooftop skeletons, and come across a familiar (giant) foe who we end up battling far too many times thanks to Tim's ability to die practically everywhere.", "Our second game is deserving of its own Replay episode, but we really couldn't think of another game with a boat that doesn't sink. Enjoy the show, folks! We'll see you next Saturday for another episode." ]

The player steps into the dusty boots of the Stranger, a mysterious drifter turned bounty hunter who is rounding up criminals to earn enough money for a surgical procedure. Why does he need it? What secret is he hiding? The game is well worth playing to find out.", "Our second mystery segment was selected exclusively for Game Informer's Daniel Tack.

For this week's Replay we're brushing the space dust off this forgotten gem.", "Join Andrew Reiner, Dan Ryckert, Jeff Marchiafava, and myself as we blast off into a wonderful Sonic Team title that graced the Genesis late in its life cycle. Ristar can grab enemies with his stretchy hands to headbutt enemies or swing around his environment. Satisfying controls, colorful locales, and creative enemy design combine to make a title that should not be missed for fans of retro platformers. There's still nothing quite like it." ]

In 2001, Square Enix released Final Fantasy X on the PlayStation 2, and it was a great way to show off the console's power with its cinematic cutscenes. It also brought us to the world of Spira, where a menacing force named Sin is threatening to destroy it. Our hero Tidus doesn't even know what he's in for when he meets spirit summoner Yuna and gets a glimpse of the cross she must bear as a spirit summoner. The budding romance between the two and their journey to help stop Sin provides a worthy pursuit to bring peace to the land. ", "With the Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster releasing on March 18 for PlayStation 3 and Vita, we thought it'd be a good time to step back in and see the game before the new enhancements. Join Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, Dan Ryckert, and myself as we reminisce on our experiences with it and Dan still tries to make sense of Sin. Later we continue the JRPG fandom and take a look at title that's sure to be a blast from the past." ]

Teaming with developer Vivendi Universal, Electronic Arts released a hack n' slash adventure game based on the show on September 30 for PlayStation and Game Boy Color. Game Informer critic Matt Helgeson gave this Chakram-throwing experience a fair grade, comparing it to the wacky Rising Zan: Samurai Gunman. A few months after this game hit the market, Titus Software release Xena: Warrior Princess \u2013 Talisman of Fate, a fighting game for Nintendo 64 that...well...you'll just have to see for yourself.", "We take a look at both of these games in an extended episode or Replay.

That honor goes to the N64 game Body Harvest, which DMA Design released three years before GTA III. Watch as Reiner, Dan, Tim, and I go on a bug hunt and learn a thing or two about maps.", "Body Harvest was a long-delayed game that featured a hero who could battle buglike invaders on foot or in a variety of vehicles. It hasn't aged particularly well, but it was ridiculously ambitious for the time (1998) Our adventure meanders a bit, thanks in part to a few issues with the game's navigation system (Tim was on the sticks!). As bad as we thought the UI was in Body Harvest, it did little to prepare us for the roulette game. That one's an indecipherable mess that must be seen to be believed." ]

Several Game Informer editors (last year had eight entries, this year features ten) get a chance to choose the game that they'd most like to see as our next Super Replay. Then, they all compete in a tournament of random multiplayer gaming challenges to see which editor reigns supreme. Whoever wins the tournament gets to sit in on a full playthrough of the game they chose.", "In this first week of the Showdown, you'll get a chance to see what games each of us will be fighting for.

Haydn was also involved in developing a notoriously flawed but distressingly successful game called 50 Cent: Bulletproof.", "We sit Haydn down for his first serious time with Bulletproof since he shipped the game. In addition to some goofing around, Haydn gives us some great insight into how troubled development can drag down talented game makers and some of the problems this specific project faced. After that, Haydn sticks around to show us another slightly less terrible project that he has his fingerprints on.", "Special thanks go out to Haydn for being such a good sport in taking a look at what was surely a difficult project for him and putting up with our dumb jokes. Show him some love by checking out the first Darksiders if you haven't yet. It's awesome! You can check out more of Haydn's commentary and Darksiders in the developer commentary video that we recorded last summer." ]

They acknowledge their reduced number, due to Dan's mysterious disappearance coinciding with his father's appearance.", "The episode starts with each of the team relating their experience with the game. Tim Turi has none, Andrew Reiner can faintly remember enjoying it, and Ben Reeves also has negligible experience. Reiner recalls especially enjoying the humor, and Tim appreciates the the Ghosts 'n' Ghoulies look of the game. Tim ponders if Sir Dan is a joke, as it reminds him of Iron Maiden's mascot.Tim gets annoyed with the camera, and Reiner digs up the other projects of the team behind MediEvil which are mostly ports of popular console game to handehelds(LBP for PSP, Killzone for Vita, etc.). As they backtrack for a Chalice, Reiner recalls a wrestling/gambling competition where Dan kept track of stats in crayon. Sir Dan gains access to the Hall of Heroes, and acquires a crossbow from an old subordinate. He contiunes to Cemetary Hill, where Princess Leia tries to kill him with boulders. Tim muses on the inconsistency of the zombie speed, and Reeves ptiches the idea for Jaoquin Dead, a spin-off of Walking Dead, starring Joaquin Pheonix. Sir Dan defeats the onslaught of boulders, and the gargoyles commit suicide in shame. Reeves says that is the same thing all editors must do if an article is not in on time, and is probably what happened to Dan. Tim says he was biting down on a Waluigi sandwich and accidentally activated his fake tooth with a cyanide pill and died. They explore a labrynth and encounter a harrowing stained-glass golem. After a tense fight, Tim defeats the golem.", "They begin the Roulette, which is Juggernaut, a game that begins with evil Blood Moons, evil clown clocks, and evil dolls. A clingy boyfriend wants to talk to his girlfriend shapes the premise. Tim mocks the slow text of the Myst-style game, as an exorcist tells the clingy boyfriend that his girlfriend has had her soul stolen by an evil force. He must exorcise from within what is left of her soul. He enters a blood bag lit world, but unfortunately has no time to blood fish. He talks to Zorro, then steals his watch and searches for paintings. After a few more puzzles to no avail, the team ends the Replay." ],

Then Dan makes a Terminator reference (of course). They discuss the possibility of fans favoring Alex Kidd over Mario, which Dan finds absurd (of course). Reiner complains that Alex is always smiling, and Dan defends him by saying that he \"just loves punching animals\". Reiner begins to demand that Dan provide a death sound for Alex, which Dan refuses to do. Reiner threatens to fire him (of course)." ],

They immediately make fun of Kid Chameleon's appearance, and Bryan Vore shares a story of how a kid he went to high school with was the inspiration for Kid Chameleon(the kid's father was the box artist). Bryan murders mecha-gorillas with a samurai sword, and Reiner relates how he beat Chikan, a notoriously bad game. They reach the second level, where Bryan turns into a Rhino and fights Gish.

While it may seem arbitrary to end a season after two years and over 100 episodes, we\u2019ve never been sticklers for making sense or following rules.", "I came up with the idea of a second season over a year ago, but wanted to bat around ideas with the Replay crew regarding new elements to make sure Season 2 wasn\u2019t just a logo change. While this is still the same Replay you know and love, we\u2019re going to have more fun with the second segment. We enjoyed taking shorter looks at our Roulette games, but we wanted more creative freedom for the second segment. Dan, Tim and I have thrown around dozens of new ideas \u2013 ranging from the informative to the insane \u2013 and we like the idea of our viewers not knowing what the second segment will be. We\u2019ll still do Roulette on occasion, but as you\u2019ll see in the weeks ahead, you\u2019ll frequently be met with surprises.", "After viewing our lengthy look at GoldenEye 007, a highly requested title from our viewers and Replay cast, you\u2019ll get the first taste of the type of things we can do with this second segment. It\u2019s one of our wackier ideas, and there\u2019s a chance it won\u2019t return, but we\u2019d like to create an air of unpredictability with each episode as we move forward.", "The Replay crew extends big thanks to Game Informer alumni Thomas Blustin for his tireless work on creating Replay\u2019s new logo, and Joe Kane of Joe Kane Design for the new animated intro. As always, this show wouldn\u2019t be anything special without the video and audio expertise of Ben Hanson and Jason Oestreicher.", "Enjoy the episode and please let us know what you think of our new direction in the comments section below!" ]

As Jason explains the management aspect, Phil wonder if it will be present in 2K's FPS reimagining and Reiner confirms that it is. They research Laser Pistols, and deploy fighters after an alien ship. It out runs them twice, then lands. They outfit their crack squad of GI trained soldiers and exit the dropship to defeat the alien menace. They immediately lose a soldier, and suspect of the aliens of laughing at them and high-fiving in the fog of war. They lose another soldier once the alien's turn starts, much to Reiner's amusement. The recruits have horrible aim, unable to kill an alien just a few paces in front of them. Another soldier drops on the alien's turn, and on Jason's a soldier goes insane and finally manages to kill something. Reeves sprinkles his non-sequiter \"street comedy\" throughout the banter. Another soldier dies. Jason's mini-cannon fails to knock down an brick wall, much to his tactical disadvantage. They discuss the movie Blank Check and Reeves suggests throwing an alien at an alien. Another soldier dies. Phil tries to end it there, but Jason curtly tells him that he is not finished and continues with the game to kill another alien at close range. Phil then moves to Replay Roulette.", "Replay Roulette is Audiosurf, and Jason plays a few songs from the Splatterhouse and Bastion OST before ending the episode." ],

Tim dies in Quest 64 due to running out of freshbread.", "When they start Hybrid Heaven, they find that no one knows who picked out the game, and then claim it might be a sign for a Super Replay. One of the characters, named Johnny, is shown walking around naked in his apartment (no M-rated parts showing) in the opening cutscene which freaks Dan out and becomes an onrunning joke during the Roulette. They also laugh out loud whenever the main character Diaz goes into a rather suggestive looking crawl. While Dan doesn't like the bland enviorment of the game, he and the others get interested with Diaz shooting Johnny, the strange combat system, and the RPG elements. They end saying they'll consider whether or not Hybrid Heaven will be a Super Replay." ],

Watch below as myself, Tim Turi, Andrew Reiner, and Ben Reeves revisit the charming Aladdin." ]

On this week's edition of Replay, we take a look at the very first Jak and Daxter game and discuss our feelings on the series as a whole.", "Join myself, Tim Turi, Andrew Reiner, and Ben Reeves as we grab every collectible we can find and take on an antagonistic bird. Be sure to stick around for an epic showdown between Ben and Tim in one of the longest and most infuriating Replay Roulettes yet -- for Reiner anyway. He seemed to dislike this game quite a bit." ]

Neither Dan Ryckert or myself had any prior experience with Luigi's Mansion before this episode, and our inexperience is a good counter balance to Reiner and Sean's misty-eyed nostalgia. Noses bounce, names are yelled, and cabinets are violated in this special episode of Replay. Stay tuned for a ludicrously fast-paced roulette.", "Note: This is Sean's first and only appearance on Replay before he departs from the Game Informer staff. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank our former lead programmer for starring on this week's episode, and for fixing the website after all the times we editors busted the thing. Good luck, Sean!" ]

If you haven't played it, NARC is a game about crashing sports cars into the ghetto and shooting hobos with rocket launchers. While I may have been four years old when it came out (significantly before my employment at Game Informer), I would have had no issues giving this game a perfect 10 back in 1988. Then again, that might be why we don't have any four year-olds on staff.", "If you can't tell by my enthusiasm, this game is awesome. Watch below as we plow through the classic quarter muncher." ]

One particularly sour title is Resident Evil: Survivor, a lightgun game for the original PlayStation... without lightgun support. The result is an awkward FPS survival horror game. Back in 2000 Resident Evil: Survivor received a 4/10 from Game Informer... but what do we think of it now?", "Join Dan Ryckert, Andrew Reiner, and myself as we begin on a crash course through a zombie-infested town occupied by Umbrella.", "A Special Note:", "Did you like Super Replay: Overblood? Thought so. We did too, and the community response to the game has been phenomenal. We want you to take part in the selection process for an upcoming Super Replay of some old, crappy survival horror games. We kick off a series of four special Replays with this week's Replay Roulette, in which we select the first candidate for an Overblood successor. So what do you have to do? Simply watch all the Replay Roulettes over the next four weeks and choose your favorite potential Super Replay game. After we've sampled everything we'll post a poll where you can decide which crappy title we'll eventually have to play all the way through, purely for your enjoyment and our own sadomasochistic tendencies.", "Enjoy!" ]

However, not 15 seconds into the first level, Dan realizes he HAS played the game before, though not much of it. He then remembers that maybe it was the western shooter, Gun, that he didn't play very much of either. But as Dan recalls the boss fight he was in that made him quit playing, he's told by Reiner that the fight Dan was describing, was indeed the final boss, and Dan had incidentally quit the game, right before beating it.", "The only time the gang really focuses on the game itself is when Dan starts kicking guys in the \"nuts,\" foreshadowing the Half-life Super Replay,", "The Replay Roulette for this episode is BMX XXX." ],

We encounter tons of recognizable foes, and even more menaces that never graced the films. Why do sarlacs change so much, and since when are Jawas so aggressive? Thankfully, we've got a set of trusty codes to keep things moving this time as we marvel at this piece of 16-bit Star Wars history." ]

With Saving Private Ryan still fresh in movie fan's minds and Steven Spielberg helping out with the story, their timing couldn't have been more perfect for the first big WWII FPS. Check out the video below to see Andrew Reiner, Tim Turi, Nick Ahrens and myself take on the Third Reich all over again." ]

Lady Lara Croft blossomed into a\u00a0 phenomena of her own, and despite waning franchise popularity throughout the years, it\u2019s impossible to deny the massive fallout Tomb Raider\u2019s debut title had across the industry.Being a bit of a Tomb Raider junkie, I host my first Replay episode to see if time has been gentle to Croft\u2019s official unveiling. Joined by fellow editors Tim Turi, Dan Rykert, and Andy Reiner, we sample some of Tomb Raider\u2019s most iconic levels and reminisce about the many entertaining ways Croft can meet her demise.\u00a0 Also, stick around for our weekly Replay Roulette. On the docket this episode is Cool Boarders 2. This one\u2026is a bit painful.Enjoy!" ]

It's hard to forget the first time you saw Dante launch an enemy into the air with his sword and then keep him there with a flurry of pistol shots.", "Take a look at our Replay below as Joe Juba, Andrew Reiner, Tim Turi, and myself revisit Dante's first adventure." ]

It was well-received when it was released and many gamers have feelings of nostalgia for it, but how does the gameplay hold up two decades later? Check out the new episode below and just try to get the cartoon's theme out of your head.", "Want to watch more episodes of Replay? Visit our Replay hub page to view them all!" ]

Despite some who may have enjoyed 1997's Star Wars fighter, Masters of Teras Kasi falls into the latter group for most gamers.

Their cartoonish brand of mayhem and sick senseof humor resulted in great sales numbers and an enthusiastic fanbase,before 989 Studios took over and tarnished the series' good name. Itmay have experienced a great rebirth via Twisted Metal: Black on thePS2, but the original Playstation titles by Singletrac laid thegroundwork for all subsequent car combat titles (a genre that's beensorely underrepresented in recent years).", "In this new segment weutilize our extensive vault to play through each PSone Twisted Metaltitle in order, and even try out the vehicular combat experimentsSingletrac developed after losing the franchise name. Do the originalclassics hold up over a decade later? Are 3 and 4 as bad as we rememberthem being? Does Tim Turi fail miserably in his attempt to blow up theEiffel Tower? The answer to the last question is yes. Check out thevideo below to relive the 32-bit vehicular combat experience." ]
